# For the colors option: differentiating between Air and Rail.
# This is an example file for use with the colors option turned ON. Between every
# set of coordinates, there is a "descriptor" for the line type. The program
# will assign a color to each distinct descriptor. For example, running 
# travelmap.py on this file with the colors turned ON will produce a map where 
# the connections between Paris and Seattle, Seattle and Montreal, and Shanghai
# and Singapore are all the same color. Note that the descriptors can be anything
# you like: names of methods of transportation (e.g. "Rail"), numbers, etc.
